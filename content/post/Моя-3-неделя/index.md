**Took a lot of work**
Not so long ago I found out that we were selected for the ASSC! Our team miraculously won the last ticket to the final stage, so I devoted almost the whole previous week to chess... I think that I'm confident in my abilities and that we'll make it. And now I, like at the end of the previous week, am in a hurry to do my lab work ahead of time, so as not to fall behind on the program because of this trip, since the tournament will be held in Saransk.
