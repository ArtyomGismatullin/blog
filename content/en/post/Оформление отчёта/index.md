**Reporting in Markdown**

Markdown markup is popular because of its simplicity. You format text in text by specifying whether it is a header, italics or a picture. You save it on simple text files. They are very fast to open, weigh very little, the content is easily convertible to pdf and docx, and can be easily posted on the Internet
